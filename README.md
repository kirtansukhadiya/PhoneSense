# Phonesense – Smartphone Addiction Prediction

[PhoneSense App on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Peekaboo2803/phonesense)

**Phonesense** is a machine learning project that predicts the **risk level of smartphone addiction** (Low / Moderate / High) based on user behavior and survey data. It helps in understanding phone usage patterns and identifying potential addiction risks.

## 🧩 Pipeline Overview

Load Data – Load CSV dataset using pandas.  
Preprocessing – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize/standardize features.  
Feature Engineering – Examples: average screen time, number of social media apps, usage during study hours.  
Modeling – Train and test models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.  
Evaluation – Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score; confusion matrix.  
Visualization – Feature distributions, correlation heatmaps, model performance plots.
